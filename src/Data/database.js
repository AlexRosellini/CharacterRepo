        short: `The Scion of the Minamoto Family, Rei was chosen by cosmic beings known as Aeon to bring balance to 
        the universe`,
        Prelude1: `Shokuro Rei, is the adoptive son of Shokuro Toriaka; a Noble Samurai who was exiled from Minkai after killing his corrupted lord. Arriving in the now collapsed Empire of Lung Wa devolved into a series of warring states. One of these warring States, Lingshen launched an invasion of nearby cities, and its particularly brutal oppression of conquered populations shocked Toriaka, reminding him of his former lord.  In what is known legend, Toriaka found help amongst the Samurai Elves of Jinin, and the Taldan Colonists of Amannar, he united the people of the conquered province and declared independence; the nation of “Shokuro” was born.`,
        Prelude2: `Toriaka would become known as the “Sun Shogun” and the nation of Shokuro continues to prosper, keeping Lingshen at bay with defensive strategies, and the alliance of Shokuro with the Elves of Jinin, and the Avistani people of Amannar. As a result, the capital of  Mukinami  prospers as a true melting spot of various cultures.`,
        Childhood1: `Rei came to be adopted by Toriaka through the death of his father, Orin, a retainer and close friend of Toriaka whom followed him in exile and died in the battle with Lingshen. Although Toriaka had already an heir in Shokuro Ayato, he could not let the son of his friend on his own, and he would eventually decide to adopt him. 
        To say that Rei  had a difficult childhood would be a lie; shortly after being adopted he was blessed with a little sister, Miyuki with whom he formed an instantaneous bond, growing more to her as a big brother than Ayato whom was - as the heir to the throne - often with his father in battle. The general absence of his father and elder brother, did not deter Rei either, instead he would come to idolize his father and elder brother, often being the first to welcome them home from battle and asking for stories of their conflicts. The only true detriment to his happiness would be Miyu, his adoptive mother. Although the latter never truly did anything to him, she had been against the adoption from the get go, and had no qualm to make that clear - Rei was not her son.`,
        Childhood2: `Regardless of that Rei would soon study to become a Samurai, while his sister in Parallele received teachings to become a mage. His lack of maternal relationship would lead Rei to come to see one of his teachers, Astesia as a surrogate mother. Astesia was in charge of teaching him about the great beyond. A broad topic ranging to Golarion and its geography, the material plane and its planets, and Rei’s favorite topic, the various planes, be they of the inner or the outer sphere. The two classes that Rei never missed, were the physical ones meant to improve its skills with a sword, and those of Astesia.`,
        Adulthood1: `Rei's happy life could not so easily last however, and as the war against Lingshen became increasingly on the losing side; Rei was pulled to his first battle, along with his sister Miyuki. The brutality of the conflict and the loss of the battle would weigh deeply on his mind and Rei took his training afterward with a far more cold outlook, much to the worry of his sister Miyuki.`,
