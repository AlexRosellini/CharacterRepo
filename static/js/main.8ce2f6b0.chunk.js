Arriving in the now collapsed Empire of Lung Wa devolved into a series of warring states. One of these warring States, Lingshen launched an invasion of nearby cities, and its particularly brutal oppression of conquered populations shocked Toriaka, reminding him of his former lord.  In what is known legend, Toriaka found help amongst the Samurai Elves of Jinin, and the Taldan Colonists of Amannar, he united the people of the conquered province and declared independence; the nation of \u201cShokuro\u201d was born.",Prelude2:"Toriaka would become known as the \u201cSun Shogun\u201d and the nation of Shokuro continues to prosper, keeping Lingshen at bay with defensive strategies, and the alliance of Shokuro with the Elves of Jinin, and the Avistani people of Amannar. As a result, the capital of  Mukinami  prospers as a true melting spot of various cultures.",Childhood1:"Rei came to be adopted by Toriaka through the death of his father, Orin, a retainer and close friend of Toriaka whom followed him in exile and died in the battle with Lingshen. Although Toriaka had already an heir in Shokuro Ayato, he could not let the son of his friend on his own, and he would eventually decide to adopt him. \n        To say that Rei  had a difficult childhood would be a lie; shortly after being adopted he was blessed with a little sister, Miyuki with whom he formed an instantaneous bond, growing more to her as a big brother than Ayato whom was - as the heir to the throne - often with his father in battle. The general absence of his father and elder brother, did not deter Rei either, instead he would come to idolize his father and elder brother, often being the first to welcome them home from battle and asking for stories of their conflicts. The only true detriment to his happiness would be Miyu, his adoptive mother. Although the latter never truly did anything to him, she had been against the adoption from the get go, and had no qualm to make that clear - Rei was not her son.",Childhood2:"Regardless of that Rei would soon study to become a Samurai, while his sister in Parallele received teachings to become a mage. His lack of maternal relationship would lead Rei to come to see one of his teachers, Astesia as a surrogate mother. Astesia was in charge of teaching him about the great beyond. A broad topic ranging to Golarion and its geography, the material plane and its planets, and Rei\u2019s favorite topic, the various planes, be they of the inner or the outer sphere. The two classes that Rei never missed, were the physical ones meant to improve its skills with a sword, and those of Astesia.",Adulthood1:"Rei's happy life could not so easily last however, and as the war against Lingshen became increasingly on the losing side; Rei was pulled to his first battle, along with his sister Miyuki. The brutality of the conflict and the loss of the battle would weigh deeply on his mind and Rei took his training afterward with a far more cold outlook, much to the worry of his sister Miyuki.",Adulthood2:"The war with Lingshuen took a turn for the worse after a dreadful battle took the life of Ayato by the plains near the capital. The Nation of the Exiled Samurai would be no more, it was a matter of time  - And this reality dawned upon Rei like a truck. To his surprise however, as well as his dismay, his father Toriaka seemed resolved, and even satisfied with the result. Rei would forever remember his words, as they both stood upon the walls of the capital, looking at the great enemy army.",Adulthood3:" \u201cDon\u2019t look away Rei, this is our greatest success. True, tomorrow we will die. This city will be buried under the rubble, and those that refused to evacuate, will suffer a fate worse than death. But this army ahead of us, they march to the doom of their nation. This war had them antagonize the distant Taldor, the Samurai Elves of Jinin, and the lords of the province they took. By the end of this decade, Lingshuen will be no more; Shokuro will be freed by another man, it may take a new name - But it is there that we proved that we could win, that we could build a nation...And that Tyranny holds no sway in a world of men.\u201d",Adulthood4:"Rei listened with attention; for Sacrifice is part of the Samurai way, and his Father reminded him of this grim lesson. Shokuro had stood for forty years under siege, it had done more: it had prospered. Now the nations of Tian Xia would rise against Lingshuen, Jinin would not ignore the loss of their allies, Taldor would cut the only trade access Lingshuen has with the west. Even in far off Minkai, he had no doubt that voices would rise to avenge the Exile.\n        And so as he glanced at his father with admiration, he rejected his offer to retreat. Rei would fight, and Rei would die for his country. ",Adulthood5:"Perhaps it was to no one\u2019s surprise that Miyuki refused to evacuate, that his teacher Astesia as well, decided to remain there upon the walls - But Rei had somehow hoped to save them...And the grim reality that they would all perish here, dawned upon him. I will not recount the battle that occurred that day, for it was fire and death. Separated from his father and put in charge of defending the Church of Desna where his teacher and the citizens had taken refuge, Rei, his sister and their Units were surrounded...Until that is, the voice of the Aeon was heard.",Personality1:"Rei embodies, or try to at the very least, the values of the Bushido, that aspect however as him rigorous both on himself and others, he except the best a person can offer and was often antagonized by his troops as a result - Only his sister truly understand that his brother puts a front, and would want for nothing more to find some good friends. Rei is otherwise highly interested in foreign culture, and is an avid reader; he casually enjoys music and plays the flute.",Personality2:"Rei is also highly interested in cosmology, the study of the planes, as well as the two spheres of the universe, he is thus familiar with some basic knowledge on the inner workings of the Multiverse.",npc1Name:"Miyuki",npc2Name:"Astesia",Npc1Desc1:"Miyuki is the adoptive sister of Rei, and the daughter of Toriaki. Born the same year Rei was adopted, the two developed a close bond, whereas Miyuki antagonized herself from the rest of her family, whose absence she deplored. Instead, she came to rely on her adoptive brother more, until the two became inseparable.",Npc1Desc2:"Miyuki disapproved of her brother's decision to become a Samurai, having herself much prefered the life of an adventurer. In spite of her lust for adventure, she instead remained with her brother and studied to become a mage, as her affinity with the ice school was extremely high. By the time of the Invasion of Lingshuen, Miyuki was already graduated, and had fought before at the same battle her brother fought, a battle that forever marked her with the fear of losing the people she loves. Perhaps it is as a result of that, that when her brother refused to retreat so did she - Deciding to make a stand with the brother that had always been here for her, the two fought side by side as the city fell.",Npc2Desc1:"Originally a researcher from Taldor, Astesia traveled to the Colony of Amanandar to study Tian cosmology and compare it with what is known in Avistan. In the end however, fascinated by the so-called nation of \u2018Exiled Samurai\u2019 she traveled there and took a job as a tutor to the young Rei Shokuro in order to finance her own research. Little did she know, she would end up seeing the boy as a sort of surrogate child, although their age difference wasn\u2019t so great in the first place. Enjoying Rei\u2019s interest in her field of study, the two would spend long hours studying the star in her laboratory; while she would happily give him extra classes on various area of cosmology.",Npc2Desc2:"A devout follower of Desna, the goddess of freedom and good, when Lingshuen attacked the city, Astesia refused to leave Rei behind and she rallied the citizen who refused to evacuate in a church of Desna, where she was by the Aeon\u2019s Arrival.",Stats:[20,20,20,20,20,20],level:4},{id:2,name:"Laura
